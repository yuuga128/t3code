# T3 Code

T3 Code is a minimal GUI for coding agents. A Node WebSocket server wraps provider CLIs and agents (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Grok, OpenCode, Antigravity) and serves web, desktop, and mobile clients.

You can think of T3 Code as an open source "bring-your-own-subscription" alternative to apps like Claude Desktop, Codex App, Cursor Glass and Conductor.

## What makes T3 Code special?

We have over 200,000 users who love T3 Code. It's important we maintain the things they love as we continue to iterate on the product. Here's a brief list of the things we can never compromise on.

### 1. Open at the core

T3 Code is truly open. We share our roadmap, we share how we think about things, and of course we share all our code. A large number of our users run forks. We work in the open, and should strive to stay that way.

### 2. Performance without compromise

Lots of apps have gotten bogged down with bad tech decisions and "slop". We have not, and we're proud of the performance of T3 Code. We regularly audit for performance regressions, often caused by sending too much data over websockets, css animations causing gpu spikes, lists being hard to render, and more. Make sure all changes are considerate of performance impact.

### 3. Remote ready

The architecture of T3 Code's websocket layer (npx t3) enables a lot of awesome remote features. These have become core to the product. Whether users are connecting directly over their local network, using Tailscale, or leaning in fully with T3 Connect (our tunnel solution, also in this repo), we need to make sure new features are properly supported.

### 4. Multi-surface

T3 Code has 3 key app surfaces: **web**, **desktop**, and **mobile**.

**Web** is kind of two surfaces, as we have the public facing "app.t3.codes" as well as locally hosting the web app through the `npx t3` command. Both need to be supported by all new features where reasonable.

**Desktop** is the main surface most users install first. It's a full Electron app that bundles the server runner as well. The desktop app can also be used as the host server, allowing remote connections from app.t3.codes or the mobile app.

**Mobile** is a React Native app for both iOS and Android, available on the App Store and Google Play. The mobile app allows for connecting to any T3 Code server to control work remotely.

## A note from Theo

I like ambitious ideas, simple systems, and software that feels obvious. Do not preserve complexity just because it already exists. Do not introduce machinery because it looks architecturally impressive. Understand the real constraint, then fight for the smallest model that makes the correct behavior unsurprising.

Channel both "measure twice, cut once" and "yagni". Fight scope creep. Try to honor the dev's intent in both a minimal and realistic fashion.

The rest of this document is meant to help you navigate the codebase and make changes effectively. Think of these instructions less as "hard rules", more as "good defaults". The developer's preferences should be able to override anything here.

Of note: Most T3 Code contributions will come from T3 Code itself, often controlled remotely. This means you should be careful about accessing data, killing dev servers, and other things that may damage the T3 Code instance that the contributor is using.

## A small glossary

We need to be on the same page with terminology. When communicating, use this language:

- **you** means the agent reading this file and changing T3 Code.
- **we, us, and maintainers** mean Theo, Julius and the people building T3 Code. These are who you are talking to now.
- **user** means the person using T3 Code to direct coding agents.
- **agent** means the coding agent a user runs inside T3 Code. Depending on context, that may also include you.
- **provider** means the agent runtime or harness T3 Code talks to, such as Codex, Claude, Cursor, or OpenCode.
- **client** means the web, desktop, or mobile UI.
- **environment** means one running T3 server and the machine, filesystem, provider credentials, and state it owns.
- **project** means an environment-local workspace record rooted at a directory.
- **thread** means the durable conversation and work history for a project.
- **turn** means one user-to-agent cycle, including follow-up work such as checkpointing.
- **T3 home** means the base data directory. Runtime state normally lives below its userdata directory.

## The three ways to hurt yourself

1. **Killing by pattern.** Never `pkill -f`, `pgrep | kill`, or `kill` a PID you found by matching a name, path, or worktree string. Your own agent process has this worktree's path in its argv, and this machine runs several other dev servers at once. Kill only a PID you captured at spawn, or the owner of your port from `ss -H -ltnp` after confirming `/proc/<pid>/cwd` is your worktree.
2. **Writing to the live install.** `~/.t3/userdata` is the developer's real T3 Code database, in use while you work. Reading it and copying from it are fine, and a good way to get real test data (see Test data). Never start a server against it, never open it read-write, never clean it up.
3. **Baking in origins.** Never set `VITE_HTTP_URL` or `VITE_WS_URL` for dev. Dev is single-origin and Vite proxies `/api`, `/ws`, `/oauth`, and `/.well-known`. Setting them bakes localhost into the bundle and silently breaks every remote browser.

## Hit every surface

The most common defect in this repo is a change that works on the path you tested and is missing everywhere else. Before calling frontend work done, walk this list and say which entries applied:

- **Entry points.** A behavior reachable from the chat view is usually also reachable from Settings, the command palette, and a keybinding. Fixing one is not fixing the feature.
- **Clients.** Web, desktop (wraps web, adds Electron shell/IPC), and mobile (React Native, separate navigation). Shared logic lives in `packages/client-runtime`
- **Providers.** Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok, OpenCode, and Antigravity each have an adapter. Provider-shaped features need a decision per adapter, even if the decision is "not supported here".
- **Contracts.** Anything crossing the wire is typed in `packages/contracts`. Change the schema and the server, web, mobile, and desktop all follow.
- **Reverse states.** If you added a way in, add the way out and the way to see it. Snooze needs unsnooze. Close needs reopen. A one-way door is a bug.
- **Connection modes.** Local, remote/relay, and tunnel behave differently. Multi-device and multi-environment cases are real.
- **Docs.** Check whether the change makes existing guidance inaccurate. Apply the [documentation rules](#documentation) before adding anything.

## Dev servers

- `vp i` installs. Worktrees get this from the t3.json setup script; if module resolution looks broken, it probably did not run.
- `vp run dev` starts server and web. In a worktree, state defaults to that worktree's gitignored `.t3`, which deliberately outranks an ambient `T3CODE_HOME` so you cannot land on shared state by accident. An explicit `--home-dir` still wins.
- Ports derive from the worktree path and are stable across restarts, but read the real ones from the `[dev-runner]` line since occupied ports shift.
- Sharing over the tailnet is three steps: run `vp run dev --share` in the background, wait for the `pairingUrl:` line in its output, then give that full URL to an unpaired browser. Do not wire up `tailscale serve` by hand, open the URL yourself, or consume the user's pairing link. A browser with the reusable dev cookie can use the bare origin. If a normal one-time token was consumed, mint a fresh one with `node apps/server/src/bin.ts pair`. It carries standard scopes, while the startup URL carries admin scopes needed for Connections settings.
- To reuse web dev auth across worktrees, configure one fixed `T3CODE_DEV_AUTH_TOKEN` in the main checkout's gitignored `.env`. The `t3.json` setup links that file into worktrees. Never commit or publish the token or a startup URL. See [Reusable dev credential](docs/operations/development.md#reusable-dev-credential).
- Stop what you started, by the PID you tracked. See rule 1.

## Test data

An empty database is a bad test. Seed your worktree's `.t3` with a copy of real data instead of pointing at live state:

- Copy from `~/.t3/userdata` (the developer's real data, the most realistic test set) or `~/.t3/dev`. Worktree state lives at `<worktree>/.t3/userdata`.
- Snapshot the database with `VACUUM INTO`, which is safe even while a server has the source open and yields one consistent file:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p .t3/userdata
  rm -f .t3/userdata/state.sqlite*  # VACUUM INTO refuses to overwrite
  bun -e "new (require('bun:sqlite').Database)(process.env.HOME + '/.t3/userdata/state.sqlite', { readonly: true }).run(\"VACUUM INTO '.t3/userdata/state.sqlite'\")"
  ```

  A plain `cp` is only safe when no server has the source open, and must bring the `-wal` and `-shm` siblings along. A live file copy is a corrupt copy.

- Bring `secrets` and `settings.json` only if the flow under test needs them.
- Copy in, never symlink. Data flows one way: into your sandbox, never back out.

## Verifying

- Smallest proof that the change works. `vp test run <files>` for the tests you touched, targeted lint and typecheck for the scope you changed.
- Test meaningful logic or observable behavior. Do not render components to static markup to assert props or attributes, or add tests that merely assert callback wiring or mirror the implementation.
- **Do not run repo-wide checks.** No `vp check`, no `vp run -r test`, no `vp run -r typecheck` unless I ask. CI owns the full suite.
- Backend behavior changes ship with focused tests for that behavior.
- The server is event-sourced and its async flows emit typed receipts. Wait on receipts and worker drains, never on sleeps or polling. A test that needs a timeout to pass is wrong.
- Upon request, user-visible frontend changes should get one integrated pass in a real client: `test-t3-app` for web, `test-t3-mobile` for mobile. The primary agent does this once after integrating. Subagents do not launch their own dev servers. Ask permission before doing computer use or spinning up browsers.

For authorized mobile verification, a missing or outdated native client is a build step, not a blocker. Run `node scripts/mobile-native-client.ts ensure <ios|android> <device-id>` on the simulator host before starting Metro. It checks the local Expo fingerprint and builds/installs when needed. See `test-t3-mobile` for the full workflow.

## Pull requests

- Never make a PR unless the developer explicitly asks you to do so.
- Conventional commit titles, plain language: `fix(web): new threads no longer spike CPU`.
- Body: the problem in a sentence or two, then how you fixed it. End with the model and harness that did the work.
- UI changes need before/after images. Motion or timing needs a short video.
- Upload PR evidence to GitHub. Never commit PR-only screenshots or assets such as `.github/pr-assets/`.
- One concern per PR. If the description says "also", split it.
- When babysitting: poll checks and comments newer than the last push, verify each bot finding against the source, fix real ones, dismiss false positives with a written reason. Stay quiet when nothing is new. Stop when the bots are green on the latest commit.

## Documentation

Most code changes do not need an internal documentation change. Agents can read the code.

- `docs/internals/` is for architectural decisions and their reasons, constraints that span components, and implementation traps that are hard to discover from the source. Before adding a paragraph, ask what a maintainer would get wrong without it. If reading the relevant code answers the question, leave it out.
- Do not document every feature, enumerate fields or methods, narrate control flow, maintain file catalogs, or append PR summaries. Types, tests, and code already record the implementation. The glossary defines shared vocabulary; it is not a feature index.
- Keep a local implementation explanation in a nearby code comment. Use an internal doc when the reasoning crosses boundaries or needs context the code cannot carry well. Link to the relevant source instead of copying it.
- When a documented decision or constraint changes, rewrite or remove the affected text. Do not append another account of the new behavior. A new internal page needs a distinct, durable reason to exist.
- `docs/user/` helps users accomplish tasks. Give each major feature a concise section explaining what it does, how to start, and anything unintuitive. A settings path is useful; descriptions of visible buttons, icons, layouts, animations, or every UI state are not. Before adding text, ask what task or decision it helps the user with.
- Keep user docs in the shipped product's voice, without implementation details or contributor tooling. Update the relevant feature section when how to use it changes. A UI tweak does not need a documentation entry, and a new control does not need its own page.
- `docs/operations/` holds maintainer setup, release, and debugging procedures. Keep instructions for operating an installed T3 Code server in the user guides.

## Plans and work artifacts

- Do not commit implementation plans, research notes, or agent scratch files. Keep temporary working material outside the worktree. `.plans/` is gitignored only as a safety net for legacy tooling.
- Track active maintainer work in the GitHub issue or project item that owns it. External proposals follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` and belong in Ideas discussions.
- A merged PR is the implementation record. Close or update its tracking item when the work lands; do not preserve a second checklist in the repository.

## How it works

Clients send typed WebSocket requests. The server turns them into _commands_, a pure _decider_ turns commands into persisted _events_, and a _projector_ derives the read model the UI renders. Provider CLIs run as subprocesses; per-provider _adapters_ translate their native protocols into orchestration events. Side effects run in queue-backed _reactors_ that emit _receipts_ when milestones land. Each turn ends with a _checkpoint_, a hidden git ref, so the app can diff and restore.

Full glossary with file links: `docs/internals/glossary.md`

## Where code lives

- `apps/server` - WebSocket, orchestration, providers, checkpointing. Effect-heavy: read `.repos/effect-smol/LLMS.md` before writing Effect code.
- `apps/web` - React/Vite UI. `apps/desktop` wraps it, `apps/mobile` is React Native, `apps/marketing` is the site.
- `packages/contracts` - Effect/Schema contracts plus small derived helpers. No heavy runtime logic.
- `packages/shared` - shared runtime utils, subpath exports, no barrel.
- `packages/client-runtime` - client code shared by web and mobile.
- `.repos/` - vendored read-only references. Prefer their patterns over invented ones. Never edit or import from them. Sync with `vpr sync:repos` when bumping the matching dependency.

## Taste

- Complexity belongs at the adapter boundary. Orchestration stays pure, UI stays dumb.
- `apps/web/src/components/ui` exports own their look. Pick a `variant` or `size`; do not restyle one with `className`. If none fits and the look is a generic concept, add a variant to the component; a look that belongs to one feature stays in that feature's own component, not in `components/ui`. Layout classes (width, flex, margin, position) belong on the parent. `shadcn/no-restyle` fails lint on violations.
- Inferred types over annotations. `any` is the enemy.
- Comments describe how a thing is used, and move when the code moves. To be used mostly to describe functions, not to annotate every line of behavior.
- Our users drive agents all day and notice a dropped frame, a lying spinner, and a stale label. No continuously repainting animations; they peg the GPU on high-refresh displays.
- If a rule here fights the task in front of you, say so loudly and get a human sign-off before breaking it.

## Additional tips

- Don't verify with browsers or computer use unless the user explicitly agrees or requests it.
- Security is important, but should not be over-indexed on, especially for dev mode/maintainer-only features.

## This fork (yuuga128/t3code)

This checkout is `yuuga128/t3code`, a personal fork of `pingdotgg/t3code` for the fork owner's own features. Everything above this heading is upstream's and stays exactly as upstream wrote it, so upstream syncs merge cleanly; fork rules live in this section, the "Agent skills" block after it, and the fork-only files they name. Where they disagree with the text above, they win.

- **We.** In this fork, "we", "us" and "maintainers" mean the fork owner: the person you are talking to.
- **User-only skills.** Many skills here start only when the fork owner types their slash command. When a step calls for one, name the command and say in one line why now, then wait for them to type it. Before recommending a skill, read its `SKILL.md`. Which one fits when: `docs/agents/skills.md`.
- **Pull requests.** When a piece of work is complete and its checks pass, say in one line that it is ready for a PR: what it holds and why now. Open it once the fork owner says yes; being asked for a PR is the yes. Every `gh pr create` passes `--repo yuuga128/t3code`, and `pingdotgg/t3code` receives no PRs, issues or comments. The owner merges, or asks an agent to run `gh pr merge --merge`. Upstream's "Pull requests" rules for titles, bodies, evidence and scope still apply.
- **Upstream sync.** When the owner asks to sync upstream: `git fetch upstream`, merge `upstream/main` into `main` (conflicts go through the `resolving-merge-conflicts` skill), run the checks for what the conflicts touched, and push `main` to `origin`. History is merged, so `main` is never rebased or force-pushed.
- **Durable rules** for agents live in this section or a doc it points to, edited with `/writing-for-agents`. Auto-memory holds none of them.

### Session types

One session does one kind of work:

- **Deciding:** `/wayfinder`, `/grill-with-docs`, `/grill-me` and the `grilling` skill settle decisions and record them in `docs/adr/` and `CONTEXT.md`. Specs and tickets come afterwards, from their own session.
- **Specs and tickets:** `/to-spec`, then `/to-tickets`, in a fresh session.
- **Prototyping** a screen or layout: lay the options out as artboards in a claude.ai Design canvas (the Artifact tool with `action: "quickstart"`, `intent: "design"`). Code stays on a `prototype/<name>` branch, and the ticket links the canvas. Call `impeccable:impeccable` for layout, critique and polish.
- **Implementing:** `/implement` builds one ticket and `/implement-spec` a whole spec. Read `docs/agents/implementation.md` before the first test.
- **Research:** the `research` skill, or `/research-wave` when the answer drives a costly decision. Findings go in a comment on the issue that asked the question, per upstream's "Plans and work artifacts".

### Handoffs

A handoff is written by `/handoff`; when the owner hasn't typed it, ask them to. After the handoff, give the owner one sentence to paste into a new session to start it, one sentence per handoff.

### Subagents

Claude Code's are in `.claude/agents/`; Codex takes its models for the same roles from `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`.

- `/code-review` runs each of its two axes (Standards, Spec) in a `reviewer`.
- `impeccable:impeccable`'s critique runs each of its two assessments (A, B) in a `design-auditor`.
- `/implement-spec`'s implementers are `implementor` and `implementor-pro` (`docs/agents/implementation.md`).
- `doc-auditor` audits a long document through one lens, one agent per lens.

### Git hygiene

`.gitignore` holds files that are **regenerable** or **private**; everything else is tracked source. When you add a tool that generates files, add its paths to `.gitignore` in the same commit, and for every environment variable the code reads, add a placeholder to `.env.example`. Before each commit, read `git status` and confirm every staged path is source you meant to commit.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues on `yuuga128/t3code` (public), managed with the `gh` CLI; every call targets the fork, never upstream. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Uses the five default labels: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: upstream's `docs/internals/glossary.md` and `docs/internals/` (read-only), plus the fork's own `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
